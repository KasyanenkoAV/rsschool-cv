### **Code Example**

Task on [**CodeWars**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/515e271a311df0350d00000f/train/javascript "Square(n) Sum")

**_Instructions_**

> [Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.\
> For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9](https://www.codewars.com/kata/515e271a311df0350d00000f/train/javascript "Square(n) Sum")

**_Solution on CodeWars_**

```javascript
function squareSum(numbers) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    let x = Math.pow(numbers[i], 2);
    sum = sum + x;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

**_Solution in VS Code:_**

```javascript
const data = [1, -2, -2, -8, 17, 5];
let sum = 0;
function squareSum(numbers) {
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    let x = Math.pow(numbers[i], 2);
    sum = sum + x;
  }
}
squareSum(data);
console.log(sum); // 387
```
